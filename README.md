do u get what im saying, i cant make those two top facial expressions anymore with botox https://x.com/silkvanille/status/1803636408785183001

theres also my "do you know who i am" facial expression which i have perfected since hs, that i cant make anymore 😇

up until a certain point she was so level-headed, showed no facial expression https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_TqdkiG7-Q thats the goal ... that is the GOAL

do u get what im saying, in the clip, there's clearly a CRAZY person and theres a totally SANE person, and the crazy person got the sane person down to their CRAZY level within minutes. thats what happened at penn, jan/feb 2017, those were crazy ppl, the entire time, and i got pulled in their game and i responded to the CRAZY with logic and that doesnt work. i should NOT respond at all was the correct response there. a crazy person wants drama, those crazy penn ppl wanted drama. https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/553315/5-types-of-people-who-can-ruin-your-life-by-bill-eddy-lcsw-esq/ im reading this on the side, and its so interesting.

either it was over after the grad level biostats class i took ended in may 2016 and i should have left then, quietly too, or it was over dec 2016 / jan 2017 and i should have left quietly. but i did the logical thing which was complain about them to penn's HR, and that didnt do anything for me but it enraged them and they came after me and u and everyone else for YEARS. so dont engage with a crazy person / crazy people is the lesson here, dont let them get a reaction out of u bc that reaction is going to be more drama for them and thats what they want.

this is exactly like interacting with a road rager, its some crazy person, in fact, u dunno how crazy that person is, and they want a reaction out of u for more drama and theyre willing to lose everything for it, so the best thing is to NOT engage at all. for the past few yrs, if someone is tailgating me, i will literally pull off to the side of the road and let them pass bc i lived in philly and maryland and ppl road rage less there, and i learned that, thats how it should be. but once i was driving home from philly when i was at penn, friday night and it was dark outside, i was on the nj turnpike north and since it was a friday night, the turnpike was crowded esp going north. anyway, there was a car in front of me that was changing lanes back and forth (like an obvious crazy person), and they got in front of me and did something i forgot, but i was like ... u know a logical person, i high beamed them, i was thinking, "like hey, be careful, everyone is going at like 75 mph right now blah blah blah" and u know what that person in front of me did? they bought down their speed to prolly 30 mph within SECONDS. on the nj turnpike. and i had to slow down QUICKLY. who knows who it was, maybe someone on drugs. but I LEARNED A LESSON THAT NIGHT, never do that. dont engage with a crazy person on the road bc they might be willing to lose EVERYTHING and bring down so many ppl with them to prove something.
