theres also my "do you know who i am" facial expression which i have perfected since hs, that i cant make anymore 😇

up until a certain point she was so level-headed, showed no facial expression https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_TqdkiG7-Q thats the goal ... that is the GOAL

do u get what im saying, in the clip, there's clearly a CRAZY person and theres a totally SANE person, and the crazy person got the sane person down to their CRAZY level within minutes. thats what happened at penn, jan/feb 2017, those were crazy ppl, the entire time, and i got pulled in their game and i responded to the CRAZY with logic and that doesnt work. i should NOT respond at all was the correct response there. a crazy person wants drama, those crazy penn ppl wanted drama. https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/553315/5-types-of-people-who-can-ruin-your-life-by-bill-eddy-lcsw-esq/ im reading this on the side, and its so interesting.
